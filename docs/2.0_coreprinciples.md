# Core principles of inclusive language

## Person-first approach

This approach emphasizes referring to individuals first, rather than defining them by their disability, disorder, or diagnosis.

## Cultural sensitivity

This requires awareness and sensitivity towards different cultural backgrounds. Localization is essential as it can make content accessible to various cultures if done appropriately. This might involve adapting content to fit cultural norms, idioms, and symbols pertinent to specific audiences.
