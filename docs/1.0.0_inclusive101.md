# Inclusive Language 101

## Definition of inclusive language

Inclusive language refers to communication that avoids using words, phrases, or tones that might be considered exclusionary or discriminatory, reflecting respect and consideration for all individuals.

Inclusive language is used across various fields, including education, healthcare, business, and technology. It reflects an effort to recognize and respect diversity in all forms, including race, gender, age, ability, and cultural background. Rather than simply avoiding offense, inclusive language promotes belonging and equity by acknowledging people's identities and experiences. As communication practices evolve, inclusive language has become a standard in ethical, professional, and accessible communication.
