# For individual writers

## Audit

Conduct a personal audit of your existing documentation to identify non-inclusive language. Tools like Grammarly and Textio can help spot potentially problematic language, allowing you to revise accordingly.

## Self-education

Engage in self-guided learning about inclusive language principles. This might include researching real-life examples or case studies to see the impact of language choices.

## Practice through writing

Use interactive online workshops or forums to practice language changes and understand their impact in a real-world context. Engaging in discussions can also enhance learning.

## Develop personal guidelines

Create a personal style guide that emphasizes inclusive language. This guide should include specific dos and don'ts tailored to your writing style and context.

## Seek feedback

Encourage feedback from peers or online writing communities. This can provide diverse perspectives on the inclusivity of your writing.

> The [Additional resources](4.0_additionalresources.md) section provides a selection of helpful tools to enhance your inclusive language skills. It includes curated courses, guides, communities, and tools suitable for individual writers and organizations aiming to implement or improve inclusive communication.
