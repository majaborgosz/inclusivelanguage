# Inclusive Language 101

## Definition of inclusive language

Inclusive language refers to communication that avoids using words, phrases, or tones that might be considered exclusionary or discriminatory, reflecting respect and consideration for all individuals.

## Importance in technical communication

In technical communication, inclusive language ensures that content is accessible and relatable to a diverse audience. It helps in eliminating biases and potential misunderstandings, allowing for clear and effective dissemination of information.

## Impact on user experience

### Enhanced readability

By using inclusive language, texts become more universally understandable, increasing engagement and comprehension across different demographics.

### Promoting accessibility

Inclusive language ensures that communication is accessible to people with varying backgrounds, abilities, and experiences, making it more universally accessible.

### Preventing alienation of users

It avoids making users feel excluded due to language that might be perceived as discriminatory or biased.

### Respect and empathy

Inclusive language is seen as a gesture of respect and empathy towards users, which can significantly enhance the user experience. It demonstrates that the organization values diversity and inclusion in its engagement with people.

According to a report by the [Linguistic Society of America](https://www.lsadc.org/), such practices align with promoting empowerment and reducing bias across communication.

## Business impact

### Trust and credibility

Organizations that prioritize inclusive language are perceived as being more equitable and socially responsible, enhancing their reputation.

### Broader reach

Companies can engage with a more extensive audience, maximizing their market penetration and effectiveness in communication.

### Market accessibility

Organizations that do not adopt inclusive language may miss opportunities to engage with diverse audiences, impacting sales and market expansion.

### Talent acquisition

Companies portraying inclusivity are more attractive to a wider pool of talent, enabling them to hire from a more diverse and skilled workforce.

### Financial results

While specific financial outcomes from using inclusive language in content are less frequently isolated, there is significant evidence linking diversity and inclusion with better business performance. [McKinsey's 'Diversity Wins' report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters) (2020) found that companies more ethically involved in diversity practices are more likely to see higher profits.
