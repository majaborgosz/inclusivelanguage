# Core principles of inclusive language

## Person-first approach

This approach emphasizes referring to individuals first, rather than defining them by their disability, disorder, or diagnosis.

## Gender-neutral language

This involves using terms that do not specify a particular gender when it is unnecessary.

## Cultural sensitivity

This requires awareness and sensitivity towards different cultural backgrounds. Localization is essential as it can make content accessible to various cultures if done appropriately. This might involve adapting content to fit cultural norms, idioms, and symbols pertinent to specific audiences.

Language should respect and reflect individuals of all ages. It involves using terms that do not patronize or stereotype individuals based on their age.
