# Implementation guide

## For individuals writers

### Audit

Conduct a personal audit of your existing documentation to identify non-inclusive language. Tools like Grammarly and Textio can help spot potentially problematic language, allowing you to revise accordingly.

### Self-education

Engage in self-guided learning about inclusive language principles. This might include researching real-life examples or case studies to see the impact of language choices.

### Practice through writing

Use interactive online workshops or forums to practice language changes and understand their impact in a real-world context. Engaging in discussions can also enhance learning.

### Develop personal guidelines

Create a personal style guide that emphasizes inclusive language. This guide should include specific dos and don'ts tailored to your writing style and context.

### Seek feedback

Encourage feedback from peers or online writing communities. This can provide diverse perspectives on the inclusivity of your writing.

## For organisations

### Audit

Perform a comprehensive audit of all existing content, identifying areas that include non-inclusive language. Use tools like Grammarly or Textio to assist in spotting problematic language.

### Training programs

Develop and conduct regular training sessions focused on inclusive language principles. These sessions can include real-life scenarios to practice language changes and understand their impact.

Utilize interactive workshops that provide role-playing exercises or discussions to engage participants in learning.

### Inclusive language guidelines

| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resistance to change                  | Implement change management strategies that include education on the benefits of inclusive language, providing clear examples of its impact on business outcomes and workplace culture.                                                                                                                                           |
| Lack of awareness and understanding | Conduct educational workshops and training sessions that specifically address what inclusive language is and its importance. Provide tangible examples and practical usage scenarios.                                                                                                                                             |
| Consistent application                | Develop comprehensive style guides and best practice documents that serve as references, and appoint diversity leaders within the organization to oversee adherence.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Updating existing materials           | Prioritize materials that are most visible or frequently used, and create a phased plan to update documents gradually. Utilize tools that can aid the transformation, such as writing software with inclusivity settings.                                                                                                         |
| Fear of making mistakes               | Foster a supportive environment where learning and feedback are encouraged. Encourage open discussions and provide training sessions addressing common mistakes and how to correct them.                                                                                                                                         |

## Real life examples of implementation

### Apple

Apple has made significant strides in promoting inclusive language within the tech industry. The company has revamped its coding terminology to remove phrases with historically racist connotations, such as replacing "blacklist" and "whitelist" with "deny list" and "allow list," respectively. Furthermore, Apple has substituted "master" and "slave" with "primary" and "secondary" to describe device relationships, effectively removing terms that hint at subjugation or control. Their guide now explicitly calls it "Inclusive Language" instead of "Fair Language," emphasizing their commitment to inclusivity.

### Salesforce

Salesforce has implemented a comprehensive strategy to integrate inclusive language across all corporate sectors, not just coding. By establishing an advisory board that includes corporate leaders, employees, and members of Employee Resource Groups, Salesforce ensures diverse perspectives are considered. This Inclusive Product Language team systematically evaluates language decisions, guided by principles such as Representation and Historical Context, to recommend more inclusive alternatives.

### Microsoft

Microsoft has actively integrated inclusive language into their communication methods. Their comprehensive style guide includes a bias-free section emphasizing gender-neutral and person-first language. Microsoft also integrates inclusive tools within Microsoft Word, which suggest edits to ensure communications remain neutral and respectful, avoiding stereotypes in product naming. They reinforce these principles through employee education programs, encompassing training and practical resources.

### Google

Google has been proactive in fostering inclusivity across various aspects of its operations. Beyond their 'Write inclusive documentation' guide, the company continually enhances accessibility features in its products. For example, they have improved Google Meet's live captioning and developed the ChromeVox screen reader for better web navigation accessibility.
