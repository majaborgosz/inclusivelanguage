# Business impact

## Trust and credibility

Organizations that prioritize inclusive language are perceived as being more equitable and socially responsible, enhancing their reputation.

## Broader reach

Companies can engage with a more extensive audience, maximizing their market penetration and effectiveness in communication.

## Market accessibility

Organizations that do not adopt inclusive language may miss opportunities to engage with diverse audiences, impacting sales and market expansion.

## Talent acquisition

Companies portraying inclusivity are more attractive to a wider pool of talent, enabling them to hire from a more diverse and skilled workforce.

## Financial results

While specific financial outcomes from using inclusive language in content are less frequently isolated, there is significant evidence linking diversity and inclusion with better business performance. McKinsey's 'Diversity Wins' report (2020) found that companies more ethically involved in diversity practices are more likely to see higher profits.
