## Impact on user experience

### Enhanced readability

By using inclusive language, texts become more universally understandable, increasing engagement and comprehension across different demographics.

### Promoting accessibility

Inclusive language ensures that communication is accessible to people with varying backgrounds, abilities, and experiences, making it more universally accessible.

### Preventing alienation of users

It avoids making users feel excluded due to language that might be perceived as discriminatory or biased.

### Respect and empathy

Inclusive language is seen as a gesture of respect and empathy towards users, which can significantly enhance the user experience. It demonstrates that the organization values diversity and inclusion in its engagement with people.

According to a report by the Linguistic Society of America, such practices align with promoting empowerment and reducing bias across communication.
