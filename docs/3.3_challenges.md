| Challenge                             | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Resistance to change                  | Implement change management strategies that include education on the benefits of inclusive language, providing clear examples of its impact on business outcomes and workplace culture.                                                                                                                                           |
| Lack of awareness and understanding | Conduct educational workshops and training sessions that specifically address what inclusive language is and its importance. Provide tangible examples and practical usage scenarios.                                                                                                                                             |
| Consistent application                | Develop comprehensive style guides and best practice documents that serve as references, and appoint diversity leaders within the organization to oversee adherence.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Updating existing materials           | Prioritize materials that are most visible or frequently used, and create a phased plan to update documents gradually. Utilize tools that can aid the transformation, such as writing software with inclusivity settings.                                                                                                         |
| Fear of making mistakes               | Foster a supportive environment where learning and feedback are encouraged. Encourage open discussions and provide training sessions addressing common mistakes and how to correct them.                                                                                                                                         |
