| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resistance to change                  | Implement change management strategies that include education on the benefits of inclusive language, providing clear examples of its impact on business outcomes and workplace culture.                                                                                                                                           |
| Lack of awareness and understanding | Conduct educational workshops and training sessions that specifically address what inclusive language is and its importance. Provide tangible examples and practical usage scenarios.                                                                                                                                             |
| Consistent application                | Develop comprehensive style guides and best practice documents that serve as references, and appoint diversity leaders within the organization to oversee adherence.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Updating existing materials           | Prioritize materials that are most visible or frequently used, and create a phased plan to update documents gradually. Utilize tools that can aid the transformation, such as writing software with inclusivity settings.                                                                                                         |
| Fear of making mistakes               | Foster a supportive environment where learning and feedback are encouraged. Encourage open discussions and provide training sessions addressing common mistakes and how to correct them.                                                                                                                                         |

## For individual writers

| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unfamiliarity with inclusive language | Engage in ongoing learning by consulting style guides, attending workshops, and using digital writing tools that highlight non-inclusive language. Referencing examples and recommended alternatives can help build familiarity over time.                                                                                          |
| Fear of being corrected or criticized | Adopt a growth mindset and treat inclusive language as a skill that improves with practice. Seek constructive feedback from diverse peers and view corrections as opportunities to learn and improve.                                                                                                                            |
| Difficulty changing established habits| Develop personal guidelines and reminders to reinforce inclusive habits. Practice rewriting sentences using inclusive alternatives to internalize the changes over time.                                                                                                                   |
| Inconsistent use                      | Create checklists or use editing tools that support bias-free language. Reviewing written content before sharing or publishing can help catch inconsistencies and ensure alignment with inclusive language principles.                                                                    |
