# Common challenges and solutions in implementing inclusive language

## For individual writers

### Unfamiliarity with inclusive language

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| You may not be familiar with which terms are considered non-inclusive or may feel unsure about the current standards for inclusive communication. | Engage in ongoing learning by consulting style guides, attending workshops, and using digital writing tools that highlight non-inclusive language. Referencing examples and recommended alternatives can help build familiarity over time. |

### Fear of being corrected or criticized

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| You might hesitate to use inclusive language out of fear of making mistakes or being publicly corrected. | Adopt a growth mindset and treat inclusive language as a skill that improves with practice. Seek constructive feedback from diverse peers and view corrections as opportunities to learn and improve. |

### Difficulty changing established habits

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| You may find it challenging to break long-standing communication habits and adopt more inclusive alternatives. | Develop personal guidelines and reminders to reinforce inclusive habits. Practice rewriting sentences using inclusive alternatives to internalize the changes over time. |

### Inconsistent use

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| You may struggle to apply inclusive language consistently across different types of communication. | Create checklists or use editing tools that support bias-free language. Reviewing written content before sharing or publishing can help catch inconsistencies and ensure alignment with inclusive language principles. |

## For organisations

### Resistance to change

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| People may be resistant to altering their communication habits or skeptical about the necessity of change. | Implement change management strategies that include education on the benefits of inclusive language, providing clear examples of its impact on business outcomes and workplace culture. |

### Lack of awareness and understanding

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| There may be a general lack of understanding about what constitutes inclusive language. | Conduct educational workshops and training sessions that specifically address what inclusive language is and its importance. Provide tangible examples and practical usage scenarios. |

### Consistent application

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Ensuring consistency in the application of inclusive language across all communications and materials. | Develop comprehensive style guides and best practice documents that serve as references, and appoint diversity leaders within the organization to oversee adherence. |

### Updating existing materials

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| The task of reviewing and updating existing materials to align with inclusive language principles can be daunting. | Prioritize materials that are most visible or frequently used, and create a phased plan to update documents gradually. Utilize tools that can aid the transformation, such as writing software with inclusivity settings. |

### Fear of making mistakes

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Individuals may fear using the wrong terms or being criticized for unintentional errors. | Foster a supportive environment where learning and feedback are encouraged. Encourage open discussions and provide training sessions addressing common mistakes and how to correct them. |

### Standardizing inclusive language checks

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Organizations may struggle to consistently catch non-inclusive language before it reaches external or widespread internal communication. | Establish a formal review process for important documents and communications. Create a checklist of common non-inclusive terms and their alternatives. Designate reviewers trained in inclusive language to perform final checks on key materials before they are published or distributed. |
